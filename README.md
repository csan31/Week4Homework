# Week4Homework
Honestly I did not find this data interesting. Yeah, it might be annoying if someone reclines their chair, but you can also do the same thing. I just chose this dataset because it's the first one I found that isn't a demographic and fits the criteria for the homework question. It's 3 in the morning and I'm just trying to finish this homework. My pie chart shows the proportions of people and their opinions on whether reclining is acceptable or not. I felt a pie chart was fine because there are only 4 different groups here so it doesn't get too confusing on the eye.
